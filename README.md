# Spotify-Stream-Widget
A small Tool for Streamers to show the current Track of Spotify to your Viewers! Completly customizable to fit your style.

# Spotify destroyed this tool :(
Sorry, but this tool is not working at the moment. I try to find out how I can bring the tool back to work. Maybe you can help. On the 19th July 2018 Spotify published an update which kills the local control of Spotify. My tool used this control to get the current playback info. Here is Spotify's offical response:

> Remote control of Spotifyâ€™s desktop app has been deprecated in favour of full track playback in the browser. 
[https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2018/07/19/new-updates-to-spotify-play-button/](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2018/07/19/new-updates-to-spotify-play-button/)

So they are two options now:
 1. I can try to use the Web API which means that the user need a internet connection, third party tracks will not be recognized and the user will need to authentificat the application to get access to his current track infos.
 2. Try to get the infos from the System Media Transport Controls (I will now call it SMTC) which means that I could get all the necessary playback data from any audio player which also use the SMTC. The problem is that the SMTC is not made for getting data. You can only send data to it. Maybe I will find a solution for it.

_Meanwhile, I'm improving the readability of the code so others can understand it better and maybe can help me with that problem. That would be great!_

Restart Spotify and then it should work.
